# Semester project for DataDog

We have been asked to create a simple web page in which anyone can save their tasks.

# Know issues

1. No design
+ Index page
+ Login form
+ Register form
+ Task creation form
+ Incomplete task printing forms
2. No task editing/deletion after they are created
3. Currently no state changing for available tasks
4. No automatic state changing to "Late"
5. Project overflooded with unneeded forms/controllers
6. No roles for users, no limitations of pages available for accesing
7. /create doesn't post a valid argument to the database, always set to default
8. Some hardcoded design flaws

**All the issues are going to be fixed, now that we are aware of them**
